### Privacy and security.

**Never** put personal information, API keys or password in GitHub, not even private repository. The norm to do this is to add the real `.credentail.json` to your local repo, `gitignore it`, but put the template `.credentials.json.example` on the GitHub.

The `.credential.json.example` contains example credentials that you need to fully run this script
